**Images:** You will need to populate the `/images/raw/` folder. We have taken the images from videos created by [Daniel Attinger et all](https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/me_pubs/) for their paper [_Fluid dynamics topics in bloodstain pattern analysis: Comparative review and research opportunities_](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38936183.pdf) and cannot republish their images here due to licensing. Please contact us if you are interested in replicating our work.

**Code:**
1. Pre-process images ([`process.py`](https://github.com/john-sandall/splatterns/blob/master/src/process.py))
2. Train vector embeddings ([`make_training_embeddings.ipynb`](https://github.com/john-sandall/splatterns/blob/master/src/make_training_embeddings.ipynb))
3. Predict new pattern ([`splat_predict.py`](https://github.com/john-sandall/splatterns/blob/master/src/splat_predict.py))
